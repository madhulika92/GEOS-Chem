The sub-folders of runs/shared_inputs contain input files for the different
types of GEOS-Chem Classic simulations.  The following files are provided for all
GEOS-Chem Classic simulations:

(1 ) HEMCO_Config.template : Configuration file for HEMCO emissions, 
                              customized for the specific GEOS-Chem simulation

(2 ) HISTORY.rc            : Configuration file for netCDF diagnostic output,
                              customized for the specific GEOS-Chem simulation

(2 ) Makefile              : Makefile for compiling GEOS-Chem Classic from the run 
                              directory, along with other functionalities.

For full-chemistry and aerosol-only simulations, the following additional
files are symbolically linked to originals in the shared_inputs/fast_jx 
folder:

(3 ) FJX_j2j.dat           : Mapping from FAST-JX species to GEOS-Chem species
(4 ) FJX_spec.dat          : Wavelengths, quantum yields for photolysis species
(5 ) jv_spec_mie.dat       : Mie scattering properties at 5 wavelengths
(6 ) brc.dat               : Additional optical properties for BROWN CARBON
(7 ) dust.dat 		   : Additional optical properties for MINERAL DUST
(8 ) h2so4.dat		   : Additional optical properties for H2SO4 
(9 ) org.dat		   : Additional optical properties for ORGANIC CARBON
(10) so4.dat		   : Additional optical properties for SO4
(11) soot.dat		   : Additional optical properties for BLACK SOOT
(12) ssa.dat		   : Additional optical properties for SEA SALT, ACCUM 
(13) ssc.dat               : Additional optical properties for SEA SALT, COARSE
