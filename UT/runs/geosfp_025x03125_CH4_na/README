This directory is the GEOS-Chem run directory for 0.25x0.3125 nested NA CH4
simulation with GEOS-FP meteorology.

The various input files (e.g. HEMCO_Config.template, HISTORY.rc, etc.) are
stored in ../shared_inputs/CH4.  This allows us to keep a single set of 
these files in one location, for convenience.  A new HEMCO_Config.rc file will 
be created from the HEMCO_Config.template file each time the unit tester is 
run.

A new input.geos file will also be created from the input.geos.template file
each time the unit tester is run.  This allows the location of the data
files to be customized for each user.
