GEOS-Chem DiffTest README

This directory can be used to run a difference test for a GEOS-Chem 
simulation. If this directory is for GEOS-FP, GEOS-5, MERRA, or MERRA2, it 
can also be used to run difference tests with any of these three met fields. 
These met fields share the same vertical and horizontal resolutions and can 
therefore interchange restart files.

A difference test validates two versions of GEOS-Chem. It compares model 
output from a version of GEOS-Chem in which you have made updates (aka 
the development code, or "Dev") against a version of GEOS-Chem with 
known behavior (aka the reference code, or "Ref").

Typically you can only expect a difference test to pass if you expect the 
Dev code run to produce results identical to the Ref run code.  This will 
be true if Dev differs from Ref only by structural changes (i.e. 
modifications in how data gets passed from one place to another, 
replacing old Fortran code with more modern equivalent code).  If Dev 
contains scientific changes (new chemistry reactions, addition of 
tracers, new photolysis reactions, etc.), then you can still do a difference 
but the difftest will not pass. However, there are additional tools to 
explore the differences that may be useful for validation.

Difftests are not meant to replace benchmarking. The GCST will continue 
to rely on the 1-month and 1-year benchmarks to validate the code.

## Setup instructions ##

The main directory is separated into Dev/, Ref/, and logs/ subdirectories.  
There is a top-level Makefile as well.

```
cd DiffTest_Hg_4x5 (or whatever this specific DiffTest directory is)
ls
> Dev/  Makefile  Ref/  logs/  README.md
```

In the top-level Makefile, look for these lines to edit:

```
# Reference code directory
ifndef CODE_REF
 CODE_REF   :=/home/$(USER)/GC/Code.Ref
endif

# Development code directory
ifndef CODE_DEV
 CODE_DEV   :=/home/$(USER)/GC/Code.Dev
endif
```
Here:

* CODE_REF specifies the GEOS-Chem source code directory for the Ref code.  
* CODE_DEV specifies the GEOS-Chem source code directory for the Dev code
* You can edit the default settings of CODE_REF and CODE_DEV here, if they 
are in a different location than your /home/$USER/GC/ directory path.  
($USER = your Unix login ID.)

In many cases, the Dev and Ref codes will only differ from each other by a 
few commits.  To set up a Ref code directory you can make a copy the Dev 
code directory, and then open a new Git branch at a commit at the 
appropriate point in the past.  (See our GEOS-Chem wiki page for 
instructions on how to revert to an older state of the code with Git.)

## Running a difference test ##

Basic instructions on performing a difftest are included in the header of
the top-level Makefile of the difftest directory. More detailed instructions
are included below.

First, make sure that the input.geos file in the Dev/ directory has all of the 
proper settings for your run.  The Ref/ directory links to this the 
input.geos file to ensure that your run settings are the same for both
Dev and Ref.

Next, from top-level difftest directory type the following:

      make superclean
      make logclean

Typing make superclean will do a make realclean in both the Dev and Ref 
code directories and remove all output files from the Dev/ and Ref/ 
subdirectories. Log files are stored in the logs/ directory and are removed
by typing make logclean. NOTE: You don't have to do make superclean before 
each difference test but it is a good idea to do it periodically.

After cleaning the difftest directory, type the following to compile and run the Dev and Ref versions of GEOS-Chem and perform a difftest:

     make -j4 TRACEBACK=y difftest

NOTE: ISORROPIA is turned off by default for diff testing (NO_ISO=y). 
You can add the other debug flags (BOUNDS=y DEBUG=y FPE=y etc.) if you wish.

The difftest Makefile has several other options for compiling and running
Dev and Ref. Options include the following (other compile options are
omitted for clarity):

     make -j4 refonly    # run/compile Ref
     make -j4 devonly    # run/compile Dev
     make -j4 devlib     # compile Dev
     make -j4 devrun     # run Dev
     make -j4 devcheck   # run/compile Dev and compare to Ref (previously run)
     make -j4 check      # compare Dev against Ref (both previously run)

You can also compile and run Ref and Dev code with the Totalview debugger
using the commands below. 'tvsp' refers to single-processor mode while 
'tvmp' refers to multi-processor mode.
      
     make -j4 DEBUG=y TRACEBACK=y FPE=y BOUNDS=y tvsp_ref 
     make -j4 DEBUG=y TRACEBACK=y FPE=y BOUNDS=y tvmp_ref  
     make -j4 DEBUG=y TRACEBACK=y FPE=y BOUNDS=y tvsp_dev
     make -j4 DEBUG=y TRACEBACK=y FPE=y BOUNDS=y tvmp_dev

There are several additional clean options in the Makefile that allow you 
to target what you would like to clean up. These include:
     
     make refclean    # calls make realclean on Ref code
     make devclean    # calls make realclean on Dev code
     make realclean   # calls make reaclean on both Ref and Dev code
     make fileclean   # removes all output files from Ref/ and Dev/
     make logclean    # removes all log files from logs/
     make superclean  # calls make realclean and make fileclean (keeps logs)

To find out information about your run, you can print information to the
screen using the following:

     make printruninforef  # print Ref run information
     make printruninfodev  # print Dev run information
     make printbuildinfo   # print common compile settings for Ref and Dev
     make printallinforef  # print run and compile information for Ref
     make printallinfodev  # print run and compile information for Dev

Finally, to see a summary of make options outlined above, type:

     make help

## Examining the results ##

The results of the difference test will be sent to a file called 
log.results.{met}.DDDHHMM. If all Ref and Dev files are identical, 
indicated by validation output that lists "IDENTICAL" for sizes, checksums,
and diffs for the GEOS-Chem diagnostic files, GEOS-Chem restart files, and 
HEMCO restart file, then the Dev code passed the difference test.

If the restart files (GEOSChem.Restart.YYYYMMDD_hhmmz.nc4.*) are identical, 
but the diagnostic files (trac_avg.YYYYMMDDhhmm*) differ, then there is 
a problem in the diagnostic output that needs to be further addressed.

You can explore differences in output files by using the locatediff.sh and
summarizediff.sh shell scripts located in the top-level directory. These
scripts use IDL to compare diagnostic and restart output files. We 
recommend using summarizediff.sh prior to using locatediff.sh to view
a summary of differences. If differences are extensive then the output
of locateDiff.sh will be very large.
